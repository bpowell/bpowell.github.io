You should really read that before you continue. In the last section of that post, I mentioned about automating pushing code to production. Well I have left that job and was never able to fully automate all the things. The place that I&rsquo;m at now has really taught me the importance of the phrase &ldquo;release early and release often&rdquo;.</p><h2 id=just-release>Just Release!</h2><p>Before leaving my last job, we were using uPortal version 5.0 in production. Version 5.0 came out October 24, 2017. I left that job the first day of August 2018. Software no longer sits still, the current version of uPortal is 5.4. Releasing software is a hard task when you have to do it manually.</p><p>You might already see a problem. The longer release cycles are, the longer it takes to upgrade. At a certain point you either stop updating or spend all your time updating. As everyone knows, not upgrading is a giant security risk. If you really think about it, you are left with only one choice: spend all your time updating. In this state you can&rsquo;t easily push out new features when your developers are spending their time making sure the upgrade works. At that point management gets upset that nothing is really being done. It&rsquo;s never a good state to be in.</p><p>Now if you are lucky enough to have a decent sized team and can dedicate a small amount engineers for upgrade work, you can still push out new features. Wait&mldr; no we can&rsquo;t push out new features! I mean you could, but then you need to make sure they work with the old code base and the new one! That&rsquo;s time that usually doesn&rsquo;t exist for any project. If your team is large enough, you can probably manage, but that means that if something goes wrong, there is a lot more things to debug.</p><h2 id=new-job-and-awesome-engineers>New Job And Awesome Engineers!</h2><p>I said above that my new job has taught me the importance of the phrase &ldquo;release early and release often&rdquo;. When I first started we were building a new tool to help people install Spinnaker. I started work right away to help make this an awesome tool, BUT I wasn&rsquo;t thinking about releasing this new tool just yet. It wasn&rsquo;t finished. My background in higher education was always about release when it is &ldquo;perfect&rdquo;. Yes, I know, software can never be perfect, but you don&rsquo;t release alpha software. Start ups are way different. You have to release as soon as possible and get feedback. You can make a really cool application, but if it doesn&rsquo;t solve the need of the people using it, then what good is it? This was an area that I never experienced before. Luckily the people I work with taught me this important lesson. Now any new project I work on, I start off with a way to get the product out there in front of users.</p><p>The TLDR of this post is just release your software! Get it in front of the people who want to use it. Get feedback, make it better!</p></article></div><aside class="col-sm-3 ml-auto blog-sidebar"></aside></div></div><footer class=blog-footer><p>Â© Brandon Powell 2018</p><p><a href=#>Back to top</a></p></footer></body></html>
