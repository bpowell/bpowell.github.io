I also managed a team of student developers. The students range from maybe taking one computer science class, to maybe a year or two of programming experience. A decent part of the job is to train the students to be active members of the open source community. I helped develop the uPortal Soffit security infrastructure and have committed back many security patches to the base product and portlets. Before I worked on uPortal I was the lead identity management developer. I maintained an old legacy code base that managed accounts for the University. My big project during this time was to create a way for new students, staff, and faculty to pick their own account names.</p><p>Previously I was a student developer at Oakland University. As a student I designed and built an Android app to connect to the uPortal web framework.</p><p>Committee involvement:</p><ul><li><a href=https://www.apereo.org/projects/uportal/uportal-steering-committee>uPortal Steering Committee</a></li><li>Macomb Community College IT Advisory Board</li></ul></article></div><aside class="col-sm-3 ml-auto blog-sidebar"></aside></div></div><footer class=blog-footer><p>Â© Brandon Powell 2018</p><p><a href=#>Back to top</a></p></footer></body></html>
