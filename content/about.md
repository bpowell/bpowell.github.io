I am a Software Engineer at [Armory](https://www.armory.io/tribe). I'm part of a team that operationalizes Spinnaker, the open-source project from Netflix and Google, in Global 2,000 enterprises. I specialize in training central automation teams on installing and optimizing Spinnaker and in training application teams to help them ship better software, faster, with Spinnaker. I've given talks alongside Netflix and Google at various Meetups and conferences.

I was a programmer at Oakland University and I worked as the lead developer on a open source portal system called [uPortal](https://github.com/Jasig/uPortal). I also managed a team of student developers. The students range from maybe taking one computer science class, to maybe a year or two of programming experience. A decent part of the job is to train the students to be active members of the open source community. I helped develop the uPortal Soffit security infrastructure and have committed back many security patches to the base product and portlets. Before I worked on uPortal I was the lead identity management developer. I maintained an old legacy code base that managed accounts for the University. My big project during this time was to create a way for new students, staff, and faculty to pick their own account names.

Previously I was a student developer at Oakland University. As a student I designed and built an Android app to connect to the uPortal web framework.
